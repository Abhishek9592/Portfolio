**Projects:**

**Customer Churn in E-Commerce:** Used ML Techniques on python to predict customer churn in order to implement methods to effectively bring down the churn rate, treating missing values followed by training the model on a sufficiently large amount of observations.

Skills and Tools: 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Python, Tableau

[**Synthetic Diamond Price Prediction](https://github.com/Abhishek9592/Portfolio/blob/442674176f46565f841cf062a84bc391c6bb8301/LinearRegression.ipynb) and [Football Scholarship Prediction](https://github.com/Abhishek9592/Portfolio/blob/399e8519c63addebd4f3d4c79a2ce67b78ded920/LDA_Football.ipynb):**] There were two case studies in this project. The first case study focused on the prediction of the price of a synthetic diamond based on the various properties. The objective of the second case study was to predict whether a candidate is going to receive a partial scholarship or a full scholarship for college based on school students who play football in school.

Skills and Tools: 
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Python, Tableau

**Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering) Techniques to analyze a Bank Data:** The concepts of clustering were used for market segmentation of a particular bank. This particular market segmentation exercise is for understanding the customer a little better for giving promotional offers to its customers.

Skills and Tools: 
Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means Clustering, Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques, Python
